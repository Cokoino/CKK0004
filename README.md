File structure
  
     code folder: Store experimental code
     libraries folder: Store lab library files
     datasheet folder: Store the data manual of the components related to the experiment

Note：
     Please study in the order of the course. Skip course may result in not adding library files and thus unable to upload the program to the V1 board.
